            <p><b> Erin Mandapat</b></p>
            <br><br>
                She walks into the room,
                <br>
                And everything just shines,
                <br>
                 Her smile bright as the sun,
                 <br>
                 Her love, a pure design.
                 <br>
                 She fills my life with laughter,
                 <br>
                 And banishes all my fears,
                 <br>
                  With her by my side,
                  <br>
                I have nothing to fear.
                <br>
                Her eyes, like pools of light,
                <br>
                Reflect the love within,
                <br>
                And every time I see her,
                <br>
                I fall in love again.
                <br>

                Her gentle touch and kind words,
                <br>
                Can soothe even the pain,
                <br>
                And I thank the stars above,
                <br>
                For giving her to me, time and again.
                <br>

                So here's to you, my love,
                <br>
                My heart, my life, my sun,
                <br>
                I thank the heavens above,
                <br>
                For giving me you, my one.
                <br>
